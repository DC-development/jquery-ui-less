# JQuery-UI LESS adapter for TWBS 3

## v0.1.1

Have consistent (themeable) styles
from TWBS with jQuery UI components. 

live demo of beta here: http://dc-development.github.io/jquery-ui-less/

Goal for this branch is to make all jQUeryUI widgets use glyphicons and follow, whatever bootstrap theme used, in your project.

Example usage:

```

@import "../bootstrap/less/bootstrap";
@import "../less/jquery.ui.less";

@import "themes/variables_cerulean";
@import "themes/bootswatch_cerulean";

@import "demovars.less";

```
