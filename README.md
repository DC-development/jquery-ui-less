# JQuery-UI LESS Adaption for TWBS (3.x)

A simple conversion of the JQuery-UI CSS components into .less files.
Wich comes in pretty handy as I need it to have persistent (themeable) styles
from TWBS with jQuery UI comps. 


Note that this is an early stage project. Feel free to submit pull requests, or report issues.
